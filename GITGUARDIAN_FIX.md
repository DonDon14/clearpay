# GitGuardian Security Fix

## Issue
GitGuardian detected a "Generic High Entropy Secret" in:
- `flutter_app/.dart_tool/chrome-device/Default/Secure Preferences`

## Solution
This is a **false positive** - it's a Chrome browser profile file automatically generated by Flutter when running web apps. It's not a real secret and should not be committed to the repository.

### Fixes Applied

1. ✅ **Updated `.gitignore`**
   - Added Flutter/Dart specific ignores
   - Added `flutter_app/.dart_tool/chrome-device/` to ignore list
   - Added `flutter_app/**/Secure Preferences` to ignore list
   - Added all Flutter build artifacts and generated files

2. ✅ **Removed from Git Tracking**
   - The file has been removed from git tracking using `git rm --cached`

## Next Steps

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Fix: Add Flutter/Dart files to .gitignore to prevent false positive GitGuardian alerts"
   ```

2. **Verify the fix:**
   - The file will no longer be tracked by git
   - Future commits won't include these files
   - GitGuardian should no longer flag this as a secret

3. **If the file still shows in GitGuardian:**
   - The file was already committed in a previous commit
   - You may need to remove it from git history (if it's sensitive)
   - Or mark it as "Skip: false positive" in GitGuardian if it's not a real secret

## Files Ignored (Summary)

- `flutter_app/.dart_tool/` - Dart tooling directory
- `flutter_app/.dart_tool/chrome-device/` - Chrome profile files (the flagged file)
- `flutter_app/build/` - Build artifacts
- `flutter_app/.flutter-plugins*` - Flutter plugin files
- `flutter_app/.pub/` - Pub cache
- `flutter_app/*.iml` - IntelliJ IDEA files
- All other Flutter/Dart generated files

## Why This Happened

When running Flutter web apps, Flutter creates a Chrome browser profile in `.dart_tool/chrome-device/Default/` to run the app in Chrome. This profile contains browser preferences and state, which GitGuardian's entropy detection flagged as a potential secret because it contains high-entropy data.

This is **not a security issue** - it's just browser state files that shouldn't be in version control.

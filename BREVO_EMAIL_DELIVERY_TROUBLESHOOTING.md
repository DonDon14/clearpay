# 🔍 Brevo Email Delivery Troubleshooting

## ⚠️ Common Error: "Sender Not Valid"

**Error Message**: `"Sending has been rejected because the sender you used project.clearpay@gmail.com is not valid. Validate your sender or authenticate your domain."`

**This means**: The sender email address is **not verified** in Brevo.

### ✅ Solution: Verify Sender Email

1. **Login to Brevo**: https://app.brevo.com
2. **Go to**: **Settings** → **Senders** (in left sidebar)
3. **Click**: **"Add a sender"** or **"Verify a sender"**
4. **Enter**: `project.clearpay@gmail.com`
5. **Click**: **"Send verification email"**
6. **Check Gmail inbox** for `project.clearpay@gmail.com`
7. **Click the verification link** in the email from Brevo
8. **Wait for verification** (shows as "Verified" ✅)

**After verification, try sending the test email again!**

## ✅ Good News: SMTP Connection is Working!

If Brevo shows the email was sent and you got no errors, **the SMTP configuration is correct**. The issue is likely with email delivery.

## 📧 Where to Check for Your Email

### 1. Check Spam/Junk Folder ⚠️ **MOST COMMON**

**Gmail:**
- Go to **Spam** folder (left sidebar)
- Look for emails from `project.clearpay@gmail.com` or `ClearPay`
- If found, click **"Not spam"** to move it to inbox

**Other Email Providers:**
- Check **Junk** or **Spam** folder
- Check **Promotions** tab (Gmail) - emails might go there

### 2. Check Brevo Dashboard for Delivery Status

1. **Login to Brevo**: https://app.brevo.com
2. **Go to**: **Transactional** → **Emails** (or **Statistics**)
3. **Check the email status**:
   - ✅ **Delivered**: Email reached the recipient's server
   - ⏳ **Pending**: Still being processed
   - ❌ **Bounced**: Email was rejected
   - ⚠️ **Opened**: Email was opened (if tracking enabled)

### 3. Verify "From" Email Address

**Important**: The "From" email (`project.clearpay@gmail.com`) must be:
- ✅ A valid Gmail address
- ✅ Not blocked by Gmail
- ⚠️ **May be treated as spam** if not verified

**Brevo allows Gmail addresses**, but Gmail may flag them as spam if:
- The sender reputation is low
- The email looks like spam
- The recipient doesn't recognize the sender

## 🔧 Solutions

### Solution 1: Check Spam Folder First

**This is the #1 reason emails don't appear in inbox!**

1. **Open Gmail**
2. **Click "Spam"** in the left sidebar
3. **Search for**: `project.clearpay` or `ClearPay`
4. **If found**:
   - Open the email
   - Click **"Not spam"**
   - Future emails should go to inbox

### Solution 2: Add Sender to Contacts

1. **Open the email** (even if in spam)
2. **Click the sender name** (`project.clearpay@gmail.com`)
3. **Add to contacts**
4. **Future emails** should go directly to inbox

### Solution 3: Check Brevo Statistics

1. **Login to Brevo**: https://app.brevo.com
2. **Go to**: **Transactional** → **Statistics** or **Emails**
3. **Find your test email**:
   - Check **Status**: Delivered, Bounced, or Pending
   - Check **Delivery time**
   - Check **Bounce reason** (if bounced)

### Solution 4: Verify Email Address

**Make sure you're checking the correct email:**
- The email you entered in the test form
- Check all email accounts if you have multiple
- Check if email was sent to a different address

### Solution 5: Wait a Few Minutes

**Email delivery can take time:**
- Usually instant, but can take 1-5 minutes
- Check again after a few minutes
- Some email providers delay unknown senders

### Solution 6: Check Email Headers (Advanced)

If you find the email in spam:
1. **Open the email**
2. **Click "Show original"** or **"View source"**
3. **Check headers** for:
   - `SPF`: Should show Brevo's servers
   - `DKIM`: Should be signed by Brevo
   - `DMARC`: Should pass

### Issue 2: Email Bounced

**Check Brevo dashboard** for bounce reason:
- **Invalid email**: Email address doesn't exist

- **Blocked**: Recipient's server blocked the email

### Issue 3: Email Not Delivered

**Check**:
- Email address is correct
- Recipient's email server is working
